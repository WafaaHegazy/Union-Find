# Union-Find

 Dynamic connectivity.
 
The input is a sequence of pairs of integers, where each integer represents an object of some type and we are to interpret the pair p q as meaning p is connected to q. 

We assume that "is connected to" is an equivalence relation:

1-symmetric: If p is connected to q, then q is connected to p.

2-transitive: If p is connected to q and q is connected to r, then p is connected to r.

3-reflexive: p is connected to p.
